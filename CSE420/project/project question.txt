Your lab project is programming the "Regular Expression to DFA by Direct Method". For this you need to make sure your program can build Syntax tree of the given RE after augmenting it and then find the Firstpos, Lastpos, and Followpos. Try to make sure that you can print the Firstpos, Lastpos, and Followpos by a specific method. You can verify the syntax tree by printing the children of a specific node. After that write the DState building method. You need to verify that your code work, in order to do that, you can take a Java/C++ code as an input and select two RE preferably the RE for recognizing the Identifiers and Numeric values and show that your code can recognize those patterns. I hope you understand that you need to write a method for recognizing the patterns, this would be switch-case like structure which will change state depending on the DState you previously built.
